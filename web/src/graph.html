    <h1 id="graph-top" class="title">Graph Data Structure</h1>

    <p>Many machine learning algorithms (e.g. Isomap, UMAP, etc.) employ graph data structures internally.
        Graphs are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between
        objects from a certain collection. A graph is an abstract representation of
        a set of objects where some pairs of the objects are connected by links.
        The interconnected objects are represented by mathematical abstractions
        called vertices (also called nodes or points), and the links that connect
        some pairs of vertices are called edges (also called lines).
        The edges may be directed (asymmetric) or undirected (symmetric).</p>

    <p>There are different ways to store graphs in a computer system. The data
        structure used depends on both the graph structure and the algorithm
        used for manipulating the graph. Theoretically one can distinguish between
        list and matrix structures but in concrete applications the best structure
        is often a combination of both. List structures are often preferred for
        sparse graphs as they have smaller memory requirements. Matrix structures
        on the other hand provide faster access for some applications but can
        consume huge amounts of memory. In Smile, we support both adjacency list
        (class <code>AdjacencyList</code>) and adjacency matrix
        (class <code>AdjacencyMatrix</code>).</p>

    <p>In adjacency list, each vertex has a list
      of which vertices it is adjacent to. This causes redundancy in an undirected
      graph. Adjacency queries are faster, at the cost of extra storage space.</p>

    <p>An adjacency matrix is an n by n matrix A, where n is the number
      of vertices in the graph. If there is an edge from a vertex x to a vertex y,
      then the element A(x,y) is 1 (or in general the number of edges or a weight), otherwise
      it is 0. In computing, this matrix makes it easy to find subgraphs, and to
      reverse a directed graph.</p>

    <p>Both <code>AdjacencyList</code> and <code>AdjacencyMatrix</code> implement
        the abstract interface <code>Graph</code>. The method <code>dot()</code>
        returns the graphic representation in Graphviz dot format. You may try
        <a href="http://viz-js.com/">http://viz-js.com/</a> to visualize the returned string.

    var graph = new AdjacencyList(8);
    graph.addEdge(0, 2);
    graph.addEdge(1, 7);

    <p>In this example, we create a DOT graph with name 'SmileGraph' with 4 node labels.
        Since we have 8 nodes, the rest of nodes will use their integer ID as label.
    </p>
    <p>The basic operation on graph is traversal, i.e. to visit the vertices in some
        systematic order. Typically, we have breadth first search (BFS) and depth first
        search (DFS). Both of these construct spanning trees with certain properties
        useful in other graph algorithms. The generic methods <code>bfs(VertexVisitor)</code>
        and <code>dfs(VertexVisitor)</code> take a user-define <code>VertexVisitor</code>
        functor to perform specific operations when visiting a vertex.
    </p>

        </div>
    </div>

    <p>An application of graph traversal is to compute connected components.
        A connected component of an undirected graph is a connected subgraph
        that is not part of any larger connected subgraph. The components of
        any graph partition its vertices into disjoint sets, and are the
        induced subgraphs of those sets. In <code>Graph</code>, the methods
        <code>bfcc()</code> and <code>dfcc()</code> compute the connected
        components with BFS and DFS algorithms, respectively. These methods
        return a two-dimensional array of which each row is the vertex IDs
        in the same connected component.
    </p>

        <ul class="nav nav-tabs">

              <pre class="prettyprint lang-java"><code>
    // compute connected components with BFS
    graph.bfcc();
    // compute connected components with DFS
    graph.dfcc();

                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

    <p>A strongly connected component of a directed graph is a maximal subgraph
       where every pair of vertices is mutually reachable. Note that a conventional
       DFS method cannot be used to find the strongly connected components. Instead,
       one may leverage Kosaraju's algorithm or Tarjan's algorithm to compute strongly
       connected components.</p>

    <p>With DFS or BFS, we can also obtain the topological ordering of a directed graph, which
        is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge uv from vertex
        u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering. For instance, the vertices of the
        graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints
        that one task must be performed before another; in this application, a topological
        ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks. A topological ordering is possible
        if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that is, if it is a directed acyclic
        graph (DAG).

    <p>Graph traversal can be used to compute the topological ordering of graph
        by the methods <code>bfsort()</code> or <code>dfsort()</code>. The topological
        ordering of a directed graph to be one in which, whenever we have an edge
        from <code>x</code> to <code>y</code>, the ordering visits <code>x</code>
        before <code>y</code>. Note that a graph has a topological ordering if
        and only if it is a directed acyclic graph.</p>

    <p>A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the edges of a connected,
        edge-weighted undirected graph that connects all the vertices together,
        without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.
        That is, it is a spanning tree whose sum of edge weights is as small as
        possible. There are many use cases for minimum spanning trees.
        With the method <code>prim</code>, we can calculate an MST by Prim's algorithm.

    <p>With the method <code>dijkstra()</code>, we can calculate the shortest path
        from a source to all other vertices in the graph by Dijkstra algorithm.
        If no parameter is provided, Smile will calculate all pairwise shortest
        path between all vertecies.
        Many manifold algorithms employ the shortest path among the samples as
        a similarity measure instead of pairwise distance.

    <p>The travelling salesman problem (TSP) is another important task in graph
        theory, combinatorial optimization, and operations research.
        It asks the following question: "Given a list of cities and the distances
        between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits
        each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?"  It is an NP-hard problem.
        Smile provides the Held-Karp algorithm to compute the optimal solution of TSP.
        It is an efficient dynamic programming algorithm, significantly better than
        the superexponential performance {\displaystyle \Theta (n!)} of a brute-force algorithm.

    <p>Although the Held-Karp algorithm is significantly better than a brute-force algorithm,
        it is still too slow to apply to large graphs. To process TSPs containing thousands
        of cities, Smile provides a branch-and-bound algorithm.
    </p>

    <ul class="nav nav-tabs">
        <li class="active"><a href="#java_8" data-toggle="tab">Java</a></li>

    <div class="tab-content">

            <pre class="prettyprint lang-java"><code>

            </code></pre>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>For even large TSP problems, Smile provides several heuristic and approximate algorithms,
        which quickly yield good solutions. For example, nearest, furthest, and arbitrary insertion
        algorithms are implemented. These methods have a quadratic time complexity. Nearest insertion
        algorithm yields at most 2 times longer than the optimal solution in the worest case.
        Furthest insertion and arbitrary insertion have higher bound in the worest case. We can improve
        the result further with the 2-Opt algorithm, which is a simple local search algorithm.
        The main idea behind it is to take a route that crosses over itself and reorder it so that
        it does not.

        </div>
    </div>

    <p>For tigher bound, Smile also implements the Christofides-Serdyukov algorithm yields a solution
        that is at most 1.5 times longer than the optimal solution in the worst case. However, it has
        a cubic time complexity.
